	abstract = {Stretchable electronic devices with intrinsically stretchable components have significant inherent advantages, including simple fabrication processes, a high integrity of the stacked layers, and low cost in comparison with stretchable electronic devices based on non-stretchable components. The research in this field has focused on developing new intrinsically stretchable components for conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. New methodologies and fabrication processes have been developed to fabricate stretchable devices with intrinsically stretchable components. The latest successful examples of stretchable conductors for applications in interconnections, electrodes, and piezoresistive devices are reviewed here. Stretchable conductors can be used for electrode or sensor applications depending on the electrical properties of the stretchable conductors under mechanical strain. A detailed overview of the recent progress in stretchable semiconductors, stretchable insulators, and other novel stretchable materials is also given, along with a discussion of the associated technological innovations and challenges. Stretchable electronic devices with intrinsically stretchable components such as field-effect transistors (FETs), photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), electronic skins, and energy harvesters are also described and a new strategy for development of stretchable electronic devices is discussed. Conclusions and future prospects for the development of stretchable electronic devices with intrinsically stretchable components are discussed.},

By coupling them via elastic links, soft-bodied aggregates can be created. We present distributed algorithms that enable the aggregates to move and deform reliably. The concept and algorithms are validated through formal analysis of the elastic couplings and experiments with aggregates comprising up to 49 physical modules—among the biggest soft-bodied aggregates to date made of autonomous modules. The experiments show that aggregates with elastic couplings can shrink and stretch their bodies, move with a precision that increases with the number of modules, and outperform aggregates with no, or rigid, couplings. Our findings demonstrate that mechanical couplings can play a vital role in reaching coherent motion among individuals with exceedingly limited and error-prone abilities, and may pave the way for low-power, stretchable robots for high-resolution monitoring and manipulation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Flexible strain sensors with high sensitivity and high mechanical robustness are highly desirable for their accurate and long-term reliable service in wearable human-machine interfaces. However, the current application of flexible strain sensors has to face a trade-off between high sensitivity and high mechanical robustness. The most representative examples are micro/nano crack-based sensors and serpentine meander-based sensors. The former one typically shows high sensitivity but limited robustness, while the latter is on the contrary. Herein, ultra-robust and sensitive flexible strain sensors are developed by crack-like pathway customization and ingenious modulation of low/high-resistance regions on a serpentine meander structure. The sensors show high cyclic stability (10 000 cycles), strong tolerance to harsh environments, high gauge factor ({\textgreater}1000) comparable with that of the crack-based sensor, and fast response time ({\textless}58 ms). Finally, the sensors are integrated into a wearable sign language translation system, which is wireless, low-cost, and lightweight. Recognition rates of over 98\% are demonstrated for the translation of 21 sign languages with the assistance of machine learning. This system facilitates achieving barrier-free communication between signers and nonsigners and offers broad application prospects in gesture interaction.},

Microchannels with dimensions as small as 25 µm are obtained with a maskless, soft lithography process that utilizes direct laser exposure. Change in electrical resistance is measured as a function of the magnitude and area of the surface pressure as well as the cross-sectional geometry, depth and relative lateral position of the embedded channel.

	abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the rheological behavior of the liquid metal eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) as it is injected into microfluidic channels to form stable microstructures of liquid metal. EGaIn is well- ;suited for this application because of its rheological properties at room temperature: it behaves like an elastic material until it experiences a critical surface stress, at which point it yields and flows readily. These properties allow EGaIn to fill microchannels rapidly when sufficient pressure is applied to the inlet of the channels, yet maintain structural stability within the channels once ambient pressure is restored. Experiments conducted in microfluidic channels, and in a parallel-plate rheometer, suggest that EGaIn's behavior is dictated by the properties of its surface (predominantly gallium oxide, as determined by Auger measurement s); these two experiments both yield approximately the same number for the critical surface stress required to induce EGaIn to flow (∼0 .5 N/m). This analysis–which shows that the pressure that must be exceeded for EGaIn to flow through a microchannel is inversely proportional to the critical (i.e., smallest) dimension of the channel–is useful to guide future fabrication of microfluidic channels to mold EGaIn into functional microstructures.},

The geometric nonlinear theory of martensite universally applicable to all structural transitions has been developed. It predicts the reversibility of the transitions as manifested in the hysteresis behaviour based solely on crystal symmetry and geometric compatibilities between phases. In this article, we report on the verification of the theory using the high-throughput approach. The thin-film composition-spread technique was devised to rapidly map the lattice parameters and the thermal hysteresis of ternary alloy systems. A clear relationship between the hysteresis and the middle eigenvalue of the transformation stretch tensor as predicted by the theory was observed for the first time. We have also identified a new composition region of titanium-rich SMAs with potential for improved control of SMA properties.},

Technological uses range from durable, shape-recovery eye-glass frames, to temperature-sensitive switches, to the generation of stress to induce mechanical motion3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here, we demonstrate that the uniform dispersion of 1–5 vol.\% of carbon nanotubes in a thermoplastic elastomer yields nanocomposites that can store and subsequently release, through remote means, up to 50\% more recovery stress than the pristine resin. The anisotropic nanotubes increase the rubbery modulus by a factor of 2 to 5 (for 1–5 vol.\%) and improve shape fixity by enhancing strain-induced crystallization. Non-radiative decay of infrared photons absorbed by the nanotubes raises the internal temperature, melting strain-induced polymer crystallites (which act as physical crosslinks that secure the deformed shape) and remotely trigger the release of the stored strain energy. Comparable effects occur for electrically induced actuation associated with Joule heating of the matrix when a current is passed through the conductive percolative network of the nanotubes within the resin. This unique combination of properties, directly arising from the nanocomposite morphology, demonstrates new opportunities for the design and fabrication of stimuli-responsive polymers, which are otherwise not available in one material system.},

Extreme twisting produces coiled muscles that can contract by 49\%, lift loads over 100 times heavier than can human muscle of the same length and weight, and generate 5.3 kilowatts of mechanical work per kilogram of muscle weight, similar to that produced by a jet engine.

Dielectrics, patterns of dopants, electrodes, and other elements directly integrated with the silicon yield fully formed, high-performance “wavy” metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors, p-n diodes, and other devices for electronic circuits that can be stretched or compressed to similarly large levels of strain.},

	abstract = {The sensing chair project enables an ordinary office chair to become aware of its occupant's actions and needs. Surface-mounted pressure distribution sensors are placed over the seatpan and backrest of the chair for real time capturing of contact information between the chair and its occupant. Given the similarity between a pressure distribution map and a gray-scale image, pattern recognition techniques commonly used in computer and robot vision, such as principal components analysis, were successfully applied to solving the problem of sitting posture classification. The current static posture classification system operates in real time with an overall classification accuracy of 96\% and 79\% for familiar and unfamiliar users, respectively. The results obtained form important stepping stones toward an intelligent chair that can find applications in many areas including multimodal interfaces, intelligent environment, and safety of automobile operations.},
